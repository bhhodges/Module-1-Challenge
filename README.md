# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this Project: I did the following in order to create a better functioning website.

First, I changed the tags to be much more accessible and renamed sections.

I also grouped many of the different sections in order to style them all with the same class.

Finally, I added many accesibility features such as alt text to images in order to make the website up to industry accesibility standard.
